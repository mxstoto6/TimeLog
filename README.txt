This a very simple program that logs the time it has been running.

If you put a shortcut of the "main.pyw" file in your startup folder
(C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup),
it will count the total active time of your computer.

To see the amount of time, you can open the "logs.json" file, or simply start the "interpreter.py" which updates itself in real time.

Don't hesitate to clear the json file by setting each value to 0.



Your antivirus might recognize the files as viruses, but they're safe: simply allow them.
By the way, i'll put the source codes in the "sources" folder.
